Here's how you can set up your partitioning scheme using the graphical installer:
1. Boot from the ISO

    Boot the Server: Insert the Rocky Linux 9.4 ISO into the server's drive or mount it via virtual media (if using remote management) and boot from it.
    Select Installation: When the installer menu appears, select "Install Rocky Linux 9.4".

2. Select Installation Destination

    Choose Disk: When you reach the "Installation Destination" screen, select the disk where you want to install Rocky Linux. This will typically be your primary SSD.

    Custom Partitioning:
        Select "Custom" under the "Storage Configuration" option.
        Click "Done" to proceed to the partitioning screen.

3. Configure Partitions in the Anaconda Installer

    Automatic LVM Setup:
        The installer may automatically suggest a partition layout using LVM. You can modify this as needed.

    Manual LVM Setup:
        If you prefer to configure LVM manually:
            Click on the disk to start configuring the partitions.
            Click "Add Mount Point" and choose each mount point (e.g., /, /boot, /home, etc.) as needed.
            For each mount point:
                Set the "Desired Capacity" according to your partitioning scheme.
                Set the "Filesystem" to EXT4 for most partitions, and VFAT for /boot/efi.
                Select "LVM" as the partitioning scheme where applicable.
                Specify mount options like nodev, nosuid, or noexec for directories like /tmp, /var/tmp, etc.

    Partition Setup:
        /boot/efi: Set as EFI System Partition (FAT32), 1GB.
        /boot: Set as EXT4, 2GB.
        / (Root): Set as EXT4, 50GB.
        swap: Set the swap size to 128GB.
        /tmp: Set as EXT4, 20GB, with appropriate mount options.
        /var: Set as EXT4, 100GB.
        /var/log: Set as EXT4, 50GB.
        /var/log/audit: Set as EXT4, 20GB.
        /var/tmp: Set as EXT4, 20GB, with appropriate mount options.
        /sto: Set as EXT4, 8TB.
        /mnt/data: Set as EXT4, 8TB.
        /home: Set as EXT4, 500GB.

4. Apply Changes

    Review Configuration: After setting up the partitions, review the configuration summary.
    Accept Changes: If everything looks correct, click "Done" to apply the partitioning setup.
    Proceed with Installation: Continue with the installation process as prompted.

5. Complete Installation

    Install Software: Choose the software packages and environments you want to install (e.g., Server with GUI, Minimal Install, etc.).
    Set Root Password: Set the root password and create user accounts as needed.
    Finalize Installation: Complete the installation and reboot the system when prompted.

Benefits of Using the Graphical Installer

    Ease of Use: The graphical interface simplifies partitioning tasks and allows you to visualize the disk layout.
    Flexibility: You can easily adjust partition sizes, types, and mount options using the GUI.
    No Manual Commands: All LVM and partition management tasks are handled by the installer, so you don't need to manually run commands in the terminal.

Summary

    No Need for Manual Setup: You do not need to manually set up partitions via the command line if you are using the graphical installer.
    Use Custom Partitioning: During installation, choose "Custom" partitioning to manually set up LVM, EXT4, and the required partition sizes and mount points.
    Follow Partitioning Scheme: Implement the recommended partitioning scheme within the installer, adjusting sizes and mount options as needed.

This approach provides a balance between flexibility and ease of use, allowing you to meet both your operational needs and security requirements, all within the graphical installer environment.
